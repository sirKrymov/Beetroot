                <p class="artbox__content--paragraph artbox__content--paragraph--first">his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher;
                    but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate
                    and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>
                <p class="artbox__content--paragraph artbox__content--paragraph--second--part1">The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the
                    way.

                <p class="artbox__content--paragraph artbox__content--paragraph--third">What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't
                    dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"</p>
